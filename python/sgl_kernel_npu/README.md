## Introduction
SGLang Kernels for Ascend NPU

## Software and hardware
Supported Hardware Models: Atlas A3 Series Products
Platform: aarch64/x86
Supporting Software
- Driver Ascend HDK 25.0.RC1.1, CANN Community Edition 8.2.RC1.alpha003 and later versions (refer to the "[CANN Software Installation Guide](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/82RC1alpha003/softwareinst/instg/instg_0001.html?Mode=PmIns&OS=Ubuntu&Software=cannToolKit)" to install the CANN development kit package, as well as the supporting firmware and drivers)
- Before installing CANN software, you need to install the relevant [dependency list](https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/CANNCommunityEdition/82RC1alpha003/softwareinst/instg/instg_0045.html)
- Python >= 3.7

## Quick Start
### Compile and Run
1. Prepare the CANN environment variables (modify according to the installation path)
```bash
source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh
```

2. Build the project
Before executing the engineering build script build.sh, modify `_ASCEND_INSTALL_PATH` on line 7 of build.sh according to the CANN installation path.
```bash
# Building Project
bash build.sh
```

### Installation
1. Pip install the `.whl` file into your Python environment
```bash
pip install output/sgl_kernel_npu*.whl

# (Optional) Confirm whether the import can be successfully
python -c "import sgl_kernel_npu; print(sgl_kernel_npu.__path__)"
```

2. Execute the environment variables for CANN (modify according to the installation path)
```bash
source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/set_env.sh
```
3. In the Python project, import `sgl_kernel_npu`.

### Test
Execute sgl_kernel_npu test scripts, for example
```bash
python3 tests/python/sgl_kernel_npu/test_hello_world.py
```
