## Docs Workflow

### Linting Check

- **`pre-commit run --all-files`** manually runs all configured checks, applying fixes if possible. If it fails the first time, re-run it to ensure lint errors are fully resolved. Make sure your code passes all checks **before** creating a Pull Request.
- **Do not commit** directly to the `main` branch. Always create a new branch (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature`), push your changes, and open a PR from that branch.
